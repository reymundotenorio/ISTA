CareerBuilder acts as a portal for the online distribution and publication of User submitted information and has no obligation to screen communications or information in advance and is not responsible for screening or monitoring Documents posted by Users. If notified by a User of a Document which allegedly does not conform to these Terms and Conditions, CareerBuilder may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and in its sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such Document. CareerBuilder has no liability or responsibility to Users for performance or nonperformance of such activities. CareerBuilder may take any action with respect to User submitted information that it deems necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion. </p>

              <p><b>5.2 No endorsements by CareerBuilder.</b> Nothing on the Talent Network shall be considered an endorsement, representation or warranty with respect to any User or third party, whether in regards to its web site, products, services, hiring, experience, employment or recruiting practices, or otherwise. </p>

              <p><b>5.3 WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS. </b></p>

              <p>(a) THE TALENT NETWORK IS PROVIDED ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

CAREERBUILDER MAKES NO WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR TIMELINESS OF THE TALENT NETWORK. </p>

              <p>(b) WITHOUT LIMITATION ON THE FOREGOING:</p>

              <p>(i) CAREERBUILDER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE TALENT NETWORK WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE TALENT NETWORK AND ITS SERVERS ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL MECHANISMS. IF YOUR USE OF THE TALENT NETWORK RESULTS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR DATA, CAREERBUILDER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS.</p>

              <p>(ii) CAREERBUILDER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE TRUTHFULNESS, ACCURACY, LEGALITY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS OR RELIABILITY OF ANY DOCUMENTS POSTED BY USERS, OR OF ANY OTHER FORM OF COMMUNICATION ENGAGED IN BY USERS. DOCUMENTS MAY CONTAIN INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. YOU AGREE THAT ANY RELIANCE ON DOCUMENTS POSTED BY USERS, OR ON ANY OTHER FORM OF COMMUNICATION WITH USERS, WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>

              <p>(iii) CAREERBUILDER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE CONTENT OF THE TALENT NETWORK, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BROKEN LINKS, INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. </p>

              <p>(iv) CAREERBUILDER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR GUARANTEES REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SERVICES OR TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICES IN MEETING YOUR EMPLOYMENT OBJECTIVES.

              <p><b>5.4 DAMAGE LIMITATIONS, ALLOCATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF.</b></p>

              <p>(a) YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR YOUR USE OF THE TALENT NETWORK, THE INTERNET GENERALLY, AND THE DOCUMENTS YOU POST OR ACCESS AND FOR YOUR CONDUCT ON AND OFF THE TALENT NETWORK.</p>

              <p>(b) IN NO EVENT SHALL CAREERBUILDER (OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS OR ADVERTISERS), BE LIABLE FOR ANY NON-DIRECT DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA, LOST EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) RESULTING FROM OR ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH SERVICES OR THE USE OR ACCESS TO, OR THE INABILITY TO USE OR ACCESS, THE TALENT NETWORK AND/OR ANY DOCUMENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT CAREERBUILDER IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY PAYMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN.</p>

              <p>(c) BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

              <p><b>5.5 User Authentication. </b> Because User authentication on the Internet is difficult, CareerBuilder cannot and does not confirm that each User is who they claim to be. Because CareerBuilder does not and cannot be involved in User-to-User dealings or control the behavior of participants on the Talent Network, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release CareerBuilder from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. </p>

              <p><b>5.6 California Residents. </b> If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."</p>

              <p><b>6. Links to Other Sites.</b> The Talent Network may contain links to third party web sites. These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by CareerBuilder of the contents on such third-party web sites. CareerBuilder is not responsible for the content of linked third-party sites and does not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such third-party web sites. If you decide to access linked third-party web sites, you do so at your own risk. </p>

              <p><b>7. Amendments to this Agreement and Changes to the Talent Network.</b> CareerBuilder may revise these Terms and Conditions at any time by updating this page. Changes will be binding on you on the date they are posted on the Talent Network (or as otherwise stated in any notice of such changes). Any use of the Talent Network will be considered acceptance by you of the then-current Terms and Conditions (including any exhibits thereto) contained on such Talent Network. If at any time you find the Terms and Conditions unacceptable, you must not use the applicable Talent Network any longer. Any new or different terms supplied by you are specifically rejected by CareerBuilder unless CareerBuilder agrees to them in a signed writing specifically including those new or different terms. CareerBuilder may change the Talent Network at any time. </p>

              <p><b>8. Indemnity.</b> You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless CareerBuilder (and its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or advertisers) from and against any third party claims, actions or demands (including, without limitation, costs, damages and reasonable legal and accounting fees) alleging or resulting from or in connection with your use of the Talent Network, any Document posted by you, your use of the Services or your breach of this Agreement. CareerBuilder shall use reasonable efforts to provide you prompt notice of any such claim, suit, or proceeding and may assist you, at your expense, in defending any such claim, suit or proceeding.</p>

That employer may use your information to contact you directly, including by email, at the contact information you have provided. In addition, CareerBuilder reserves the right to comply, in its sole discretion, with legal requirements, requests from law enforcement agencies or requests from government entities, even to the extent that such compliance may require disclosure of certain User Information.

              <p><b>10.   Questions and Notices.</b> Questions concerning the use of the Talent Network should be directed to Feedback.

If you access the Talent Network from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Illinois, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.

All provisions of this Agreement shall survive termination except those granting access or use to the Talent Network, and you shall cease all your use and access thereof immediately. You may not assign or transfer your obligations under this Agreement. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. Except as expressly provided by CareerBuilder in a particular "Legal Notice," or material on particular web pages of the Talent Network, this Agreement and your Service Activation Agreement where applicable, constitute the entire agreement between you and CareerBuilder. </p>

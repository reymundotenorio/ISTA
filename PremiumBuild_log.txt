### Notes ###

- On the mobile view, in the search box, the title "SEARCH OUR JOBS" was added in order to keep consistency with the desktop view.
- On the mobile view, the buttons are not aligned to the center, according to the last version of the best practices, the alignment was set as is present on the desktop view.
- On the mobile view, the title "Home Frequently Asked Questions" was aligned to the center as is present on the desktop view.
- On the "Home Frequently Asked Questions" section, the titles under the images, the font sizes were reduced from 24px to 23px, because the title "What are the pre-qualifications?" broke in two lines.
- On the mobile view, in the carousel, the arrows controls were added at the beginning of each item in order to have a better user experience.
- On the mobile view, in the carousel, the second item (A place to EARN), the "Welders" info was moved at the end instead of the "Electricians", this was performed following the Bootstrap columns logic.
- On the mobile view, in the carousel, the items were not configured with a fixed and static height because the spacing produces a non-optimized user experience; the static height was applied from 768px.
- The Terms and Conditions link located on the Join Form was removed (Possibly still showing, check in Tank please or wait for it to render)
- The client doesn't have a Privacy Policy link on their corporate site, for the moment the "Privacy Policy" link located on the footer and on the Join Form, is redirecting to the CB Privacy Policy (This note will be added to the Build closing notes to the submitter)
- The TNDID TN2N4JJ63ZYSDN7HQMN1 does not have jobs at this moment (This note will be added to the Build closing notes to the submitter)
- In order to display jobs at the JRP and JDP pages, the site in the TN_JOB plugin is using a Test TNDID TNSQ7HX69YDKJ6FCP007, as soon as the QA process finish, I will update the TN_JOB with the correct TNDID.
